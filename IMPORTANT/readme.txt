if the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elauersen/info3139/master/isocountries.json
file ever gets deleted, upload a raw githubusercontent json file to github and use that
in the .env file as the ISOCOUNTRIES variable (for project1)

this is in the case that the prof decides to take the github json link down
and i no longer have access to that json data
